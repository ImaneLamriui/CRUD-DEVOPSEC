# CRUD-DEVOPSEC
### Combining aspects of Software Development (Dev), Security (Sec), and Operations (Ops) into a coherent and collaborative approach.

This CRUD application manages electronic component sales. It has been fortified with sanitization measures, parameterized queries, and other security enhancements to mitigate common vulnerabilities and risks associated with SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Open HTTP Redirect Vulnerability, and brute force attacks.
While the code has undergone some security improvements, further enhancements may be needed. Continuous vigilance and security assessments are recommended.
